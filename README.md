# Deep-Learning-for-Computer-Vision
This will explore the the Tensorflow/Keras libraries for constructing and training deep learning networks. Convolutional Neural Networks for image classification, in this case. We will use Tensorflow as our main deep learning engine, and the Keras API on top of Tensorflow, because it is easier to use and more intuitive.
